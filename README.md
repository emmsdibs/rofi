my current configuration of rofi on my hyprland setup for arch linux (btw)

forked from and based on [Rofi by adi1090x](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi)

## **Notable changes**

 - changed screenshot.sh to use [hyprshot](https://github.com/Gustash/Hyprshot) instead of maim
 - adjusted some color settings on catppuccin.rasi (the goat)

## **To Do**
- utilize powermenu.sh instead of using the current module I have on waybar
- adjust volume.sh to use my audio configuration and then link it to waybar
	- find a way to see if it can support output switching?
- find/create a network rofi network module with a vpn toggle
